# INFOSYS722-CardiovascularDisease-HeartDisease

Recommand using VSCode or Other IDEs which has a better data visulization function to view the .ipynb file. Otherwise the data results are messy around (Hard to read).

Note, Make sure the Database/CardiovascularDisease folder contains "CVD_cleaned.csv","CVD_unclean.csv" and "CVD_unclean_2021.csv". Otherwise the output of my report and your code result have a different values.

Clone this repository might takes a longer time because the size of Database folder is quiet large.
